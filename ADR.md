# Architectural Decision Record

## General considerations

### TypeScript

I decide to use typescript because it adds static typing with optional type annotations to JavaScript. It also
improved tooling, scalability, and enhanced features like interfaces and generics.

The biggest drawback comes to the fact that we are adding a new tooling to transpile javascript which cost time and configuration issues

### CI/CD

In order to ensure linting , typechecking and test running , we could use local precomits
like lint-stag and husky or we can relay on CI/CD flows.

The approach that I follow was to setup github actions because it is a better way to work since
there is only one place to check all the building rules and do not rely on users local machine

### Testing

I like to have my **unit test** in the same folder than the file been tested, so I can group them together and
know at first site if I already add unit test for that module or not, also because when you are working
on a functionality you are likely to modify the test and it is easy to have both files under the same directory.

For **integration test** or **end to end** I like to group all of them under `test` folder

## CLIENT

**Vue3**: Vue is a well known frontend framework, as good as any other like react or angular.

Another alternative could be dealing with plain JS, in this case since I don't have too much time
and I also need to implement the Back For Front, going whit this approach will speed up things a bit

### State management

This application is not big so we could go with different approaches to maintain the state of the application and have all the components sync.

The simplest one to avoid property drillings will be using a dependency injection like provider/inject pattern and have everything stored in a global object in the provider.

The other solution could be using a standardized state management like Vuex (redux like) or Pinia.

In this case I'm going to use Pinia which is the next generation of Vuex that has a slightly different approach, based on composables ( react hooks) and modularized by default

### Testing

**MSW**: MSW is a Mocked Service Worker , very easy to use and very handy to intercept calls to the server.
We can us it for testing purpose

**Cypress**: We Will use Cypress for functional test and **component test**

**Vitest**: Since we are using Vue with Vite , we will run our unit test on Vitest,
that way we don't need tom use Babel or Webpack and we reduce the friction of the tooling ecosystem

## SERVER

**Koa**: Koa is a new web framework designed by the team behind Express, which aims to be a smaller,
more expressive, and more robust foundation for web applications and APIs.

**Vitest**: Used for unit test. This framework has an advantage over JEST since we donÂ¡t need to
bundle (webpack) or transpile (babel) the code since it uses ES modules directly with vite server

**Supertest**: Framework used to do integration test for routes and controllers

### State

Since our server is stateless, we need to set a mechanism to let the server store
information between API calls.

In order to do so we are going to share a token between server and client to identify session.
For the sake of simplicity we are going to share a random hash, in a more elaborated project we could use JWT as an example

### Persistance layer

Since we are keeping track of each game , we need to persist that information for future recovery.

We can use a Database like MySQL or postgreSQL or even noSQL data bases like Mongo and we can persist the data on file or just in memory.
In this case I'm choosing **lowDB** which they describe as Simple to use type-safe local JSON database.

I will use it as in-memory DB but I also comment the line to persist it into a file

### Interface agreement

Do to lack of time , I'm not going to generate the OPEN API Specs for the interface agreement
Ideally we should publish an OPEN API Json to share between back and front, and since we are using TS
we could automatically generate the types needed
